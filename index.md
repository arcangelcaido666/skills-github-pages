title: Welcome to my first blog
---

Hi world! This is the first time I'm learning GitHub pages. I want tocreate my professional blog/website here. I've seen a couple sites using this that are impressive that I want to learn how to do it.

I don't know if I can include **bold** or  _italic_ here. I guess so.
Also I guess I can include everything I learnt before, lists, code blocks, images, links...
